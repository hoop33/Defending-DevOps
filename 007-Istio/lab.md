### Task 1: Cluster Prep
Istio is a complex collection of Kubernetes objects. This task will help us prep our cluster for successful installation. Since we will be creating some RBAC rules, we want to first make sure that we are cluster admin (it is ok to run this again to be safe). Run the following command in Cloud Shell:
```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
  --user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"
```

To interact with Istio, we will use `istioctl` which is bundled as a binary with the Istio install package. 

Note: The Istio directory included in the lab is an extremely stripped down version of what comes with the Istio 1.0 release.
```
# In the istio-1.0.0 directory
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

# Ensure the binary is available
istioctl version
```

### Task 2: Install Istio Components and Enable Automatic Sidecar Injection
Istio is a massive project. Check out the yaml file located at `istio-1.0.0/install/kubernetes/istio-demo-auth.yaml`. Wow. Many configs. Such Yaml.

Let's install the components necessary in our cluster:
```
# In the istio-1.0.0 directory 
kubectl create -f install/kubernetes
```
Each pod in the mesh must be running an Istio compatible sidecar. The sidecar is how all traffic to and from pods in the mesh

Manual injection modifies the controller configuration, e.g. deployment. It does this by modifying the pod template spec such that all pods for that deployment are created with the injected sidecar. Adding/Updating/Removing the sidecar requires modifying the entire deployment.

Automatic injection injects at pod creation time. The controller resource is unmodified. Sidecars can be updated selectively by manually deleting pods or systematically with a deployment rolling update.

The following command will enable automatic injection for the `default` namespace:
```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

### Task 3: Launch our API in the Istio Service Mesh
Since we have automatic injection enabled for the `default` namespace, any deployments created in that namespace will now have an extra container aka "sidecar" automatically injected. This now places the pod into the Istio service mesh.
```
# In the manifests/api directory
kubectl create -f .
```
The unshorten service will spin up a load balancer. Ensure the API is accessible. Now that our pod is managed by Istio, we are not going to use the link-unshorten-service IP address as in previous labs. We will use the service provisioned by Istio called `istio-ingressgateway` to grab the routable IP address of the API.
```
kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway
```

Now, paste the IP address with a shortened link as follows in your browser and you will see that there are some issues. Egress is blocked by default. The API is not able to make outbound connections by default.
```
http://35.197.37.188/api/check?url=https://bit.ly/hi
# NOT ALLOWED or fail to resolve 
```

### Task 4: Build Egress Rules
Lets build some rules to explicit allow outbound egress traffic to only bit.ly. This can be accomplished by using a `ServiceEntry`. Check out the file `link-unshorten-egress.yaml` located in the `istio-rules` directory and create it as follows:

```
# In the manifests/istio-rules directory
kubectl create -f .
```

Once the rules are created, try to visit the API again and you should be able to successfully unshorten links to `bit.ly` domains only. 

### Task 5: Logging and Monitoring with Istio

Grafana is an open source visualization tool that can be used on top of a variety of different data stores and comes with a Prometheus integration out of the box in our Istio deployment.
'''
kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=grafana -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:3000
'''
Then Click "Web Preview" in cloud shell

Go to `Istio Mesh Dashboard` to see a high-level overview of our Istio service mesh.

The `Istio Workload Dashboard`  gives details about metrics for each workload and then inbound workloads (workloads that are sending request to this workload) and outbound services (services to which this workload send requests) for that workload.

We can visualize our outbound requests by running the following command in your local terminal:
```
for ((i=1;i<=1000;i++)); do   curl -v --header "Connection: keep-alive" "http://<YOUR-IP>/api/check?url=https://bit.ly/hi"; done
```

As you can see our `Outbound Services` graphs are looking normal. Keep this dashboard up and run the following command:

```
for ((i=1;i<=1000;i++)); do   curl -v --header "Connection: keep-alive" "http://<YOUR-IP>/api/check?url=https://t.co/hi"; done
```

Since `t.co` is not explicitly allowed per our egress rules we see the graphs change drastically.

Take some time and explore the rest of the Grafana graphs.

### Task 6: Cleanup
In the `istio-1.0.0/install/kubernetes` directory:
```
kubectl delete -f istio-demo-auth.yaml
```

In the `manifests` directory:
```
kubectl delete -f api -f istio-rules
```
(!!) *IMPORTANT* (!!)  Disable auto istio-injection for the `default` namespace:
```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=
```
Make sure Grafana is also shut down by killing the port-forward.
